Overview
--------

Opengist is a self-hosted pastebin powered by Git. All 
snippets are stored in a Git repository and can be read and/or 
modified using standard Git commands, or with the web interface. 
It is similiar to GitHub Gist, but open-source and could be 
self-hosted.

Written in Go, Opengist aims to be fast and easy to deploy.
